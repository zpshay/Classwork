In the notjava.jflex file, perform the following alterations:

1) Delete "import java_cup.runtime.*;" from the first section of the file (user code).

2) Replace the LEXICAL FUNCTIONS section with the following:

%class NotJavaLexer
%public
%type Token
%function getNextToken
%{    
    public boolean EOF()
    {
        return yy_atEOF;
    }
%}

3) Leave the PATTERN DEFINITIONS and LEXICAL RULES section unchanged from the notjava specifications.
