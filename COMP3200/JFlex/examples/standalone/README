This is a small example of a standalone text substitution scanner.

It reads a name after the keyword name and substitutes all occurences
of "hello" with "hello <name> !". 

sample.inp
  contains a sample input for the scanner

standalone.flex
  the lexical specification for the scanner


to run the example use the Makefile or type:

jflex standalone.flex
javac Subst.java
java Subst sample.inp
