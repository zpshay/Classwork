This directory contains the source code for JFlex.

For convenience,the following generated lexer and parser files
have been included in the distribution:

JFlex/LexScan.java  (lexer, generated from src/LexScan.flex)

JFlex/LexParse.java (parser, generated from src/LexParse.cup)
JFlex/sym.java

Compilation issues:

- if you have the tya jit compiler for linux, javac might crash on LexParse.java
  (turn off the jit or use shujit as a workaround)

- if you have JDK 1.1.7 and CUP v0.10i, javac -O might complain about a final 
  variable in LexParse.java (javac bug). As a workaround: don't use -O or edit
  LexParse.java and make the variable non final (it is not used in JFlex code
  anyway)  


Dir contents:

Makefile:
  for use with gnu make (tested on linux only, should work with
  most unix and make flavors).
  useful targets:

  all:   recompiles all JFlex classes, generates lexer+parser 
         only if necessary, zips up all compiled classes in
         ../lib/JFlex.jar

  build: cleans up everything and does a completely new build

  clean: deletes generated, temporary and *.class files
 

skeleton:
  a skeleton file matching exactly the precompiled scanner skeleton.
  Can be used together with the -skel option 

skeleton.nested:
  a skeleton file that supports nested input streams (see the manual 
  for the API). Can be used together with the -skel option

JFlex:
  source files of package JFlex

JFlex/gui:
  source files of package JFlex.gui

JFlex/anttask
  source files of the JFlex Ant task (contributed by Rafal Mantiuk)

java_cup/runtime:
  CUP v0.10j runtime classes, used by JFlex
